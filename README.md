## About the Project

**_Libft_** is a project of the common core of **_42 school_**, whose objective is to build our own **_C library_** with replicated standard functions to understand, implement and learn to use them in future projects.

## Requirements

The functions marked with ✔️ have passed the Norminette, Moulinette, and all relevant tests. Those marked with ✖️ have not.

> You can find a more in-depth explanation inside each source file(A source file is a file that contains the code written in a programming language. These files contain the actual code that is compiled to create an executable program or library(`.c` (for C) or `.cpp` (for C++) extension).
